## ðŸš€ Branch Naming Convention

We use a **prefix-based** branch naming convention with automated numbering:

| Branch Type | Purpose                                         | Example                          |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `feature/`  | For new features                                | `feature/3-add-user-auth`        |
| `bugfix/`   | For fixing bugs                                 | `bugfix/5-fix-login-error`       |
| `hotfix/`   | For urgent production fixes                     | `hotfix/2-critical-api-bug`      |
| `refactor/` | For code improvements without changing behavior | `refactor/4-optimize-components` |
| `doc/`      | For documentation updates                       | `doc/1-update-readme`            |
| `release/`  | For release versions                            | `release/1.0.0`                  |

### **ðŸ’¡ Automated Branch Numbering**

- The branch number **increments automatically** when a new branch is created.
- Example: If `feature/3-...` exists, the next branch will be `feature/4-...`
- This automation is handled via **GitHub Actions** and **Git Hooks**.
